I agree with the statement in part. While it's important for governments to support their major cities in order for them to thrive and contribute to national cultural preservation, it's important to remember that economic and infrastructural support alone aren't enough. 

**Here's why:**

* **Cities as Pockets of Culture:** It's true that major cities often host and amplify a nation's cultural traditions. They are hubs for art, literature, music, theater, and other artistic expressions, attracting diverse populations and providing a dynamic platform for cultural exchange and evolution. 
* **Economic Engine:** Think of cities as vital engines for a nation's economic growth. Thriving cities foster innovation, create jobs, generate revenue, and drive economic expansion, providing governments with the resources to support cultural institutions and activities.
* **Need for Balance:** However, this support must be carefully considered and should not take the form of "spreading the wealth evenly" simply because a city holds cultural significance. There needs to be a thoughtful prioritization of resources based on need and potential for growth. 

**Circumstances Where Government Support is Highly Advantageous:**

* **Historic Cities:** Cities with a standing national or regional cultural significance like London, Paris, Kyoto, Jerusalem require strong governmental backing for institutions like world-renowned museums, historic monuments, and actively maintaining cultural heritage sites. Neglect would cause irreparable damage to these resources.
* **Rising Cities:** Cities with rapid growth and a vibrant arts scene can benefit from focused investment in infrastructure, arts education, and arts-oriented development. This can stimulate local arts and culture without jeopardizing financial stability. 

**Circumstances Where Government Support Might not be as advantageous:**

* **Small Capitals:** Smaller cities may already have robust cultural scenes thanks to local initiatives and community involvement.  Government support might be redundant and inefficient. 
* **Declining Cities:** Cities struggling with economic decline may see intervention as more central to preserving their cultural landscape. It's crucial not to treat preserving a faded cultural scene with the same approach as a thriving cultural hub. 

**Developing a sustainable cultural approach:**

The government's role is about fostering opportunities for cultural growth and preservation, but it cannot do so on its own. It can achieve this through Invest in:
* **Strategic Infrastructure –** Adequate public transport,  cultural venues, and community spaces can create a welcoming environment for artistic expression. 
* **Education and Funding – ** Focusing on art education and culturally diverse funding initiatives can empower local communities and cultivate initiatives from within the city.
* **Tax Incentive Programs – ** These can encourage arts organisations to grow and reinvest into various artistic fields. 


In conclusion, while supporting thriving cities is crucial for cultural preservation, it should be done with careful planning, adaptable resources, and a recognition of the dynamic nature of cultural landscapes. Government efforts should focus on creating balanced, sustainable solutions, tailoring incentives, and encouraging diverse
