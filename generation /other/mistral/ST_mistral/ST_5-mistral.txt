I_PRP both_DT agree_VBP and_CC disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN a_DT nation_NN should_MD require_VB all_DT its_PRP$ students_NNS to_TO study_VB the_DT same_JJ national_JJ curriculum_NN until_IN they_PRP enter_VBP college_NN ._.

On_IN one_CD hand_NN ,_, a_DT national_JJ curriculum_NN provides_VBZ a_DT standardized_JJ education_NN system_NN that_WDT ensures_VBZ all_DT students_NNS ,_, regardless_RB of_IN their_PRP$ geographic_JJ location_NN or_CC socio-economic_JJ background_NN ,_, have_VBP access_NN to_TO the_DT same_JJ fundamental_JJ knowledge_NN and_CC skills_NNS ._.

Allowing_VBG schools_NNS in_IN different_JJ parts_NNS of_IN the_DT nation_NN to_TO offer_VB a_DT variety_NN of_IN academic_JJ courses_NNS and_CC extracurricular_JJ activities_NNS gives_VBZ students_NNS the_DT opportunity_NN to_TO explore_VB their_PRP$ interests_NNS and_CC talents_NNS ,_, which_WDT can_MD lead_VB to_TO greater_JJR engagement_NN and_CC success_NN in_IN their_PRP$ education_NN ._.

A_DT more_JJR nuanced_JJ approach_NN that_WDT allows_VBZ for_IN some_DT local_JJ autonomy_NN in_IN determining_VBG academic_JJ offerings_NNS while_IN maintaining_VBG a_DT commitment_NN to_TO ensuring_VBG that_IN all_DT students_NNS have_VBP access_NN to_TO a_DT high-quality_JJ education_NN may_MD be_VB the_DT most_RBS advantageous_JJ solution_NN ._.
