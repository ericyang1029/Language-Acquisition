<pad> I disagree. I would still rather take photos than write. I also think that it should be more helpful to be able to re-edit videos, and not to be able to be able to change the filename. I think that re-editing can be less time consuming than re-taking a photo or record. I think that re-editing video is a better way to preserve the images. The video camera has great potential, and a lot of people have already started using the camera, so it will continue to be a very useful tool in documenting contemporary life. I think that the fact that the video camera is such an accurate and convincing record of contemporary life makes it even more valuable than written records. It is a record that is needed for a reason, and to document it. I think it should be more accurate, and that is why it has become so valuable. I think that you should just be able to take photos and record yourself, instead of using a digital camera and a paper recorder. It is just the same thing. There is just no better record of contemporary life than what is being recorded. I don't see why video photography isn't used as much in our daily life, because it has such a great potential for the future, and it will be very useful for people today.
