While competition undoubtedly plays a role in motivating individuals to strive for success, I believe that **instilling a sense of cooperation as the primary focus for preparing young people for leadership is ultimately more beneficial for society**.  

Here's why:

**Advantages of Cooperation:**

* **Collaborative Problem Solving:**  Leadership in any field increasingly demands the ability to bring people together, understand diverse perspectives, and find solutions that benefit the collective. Cooperation fosters empathy, communication skills, and a willingness to compromise – all essential for effective leadership in today's complex world.
* **Shared Responsibility:**  Leaders who understand the importance of shared responsibility are more likely to build strong teams, delegate effectively, and create a sense of ownership and accountability amongst their followers. This leads to more sustainable and impactful outcomes.
* **Ethical Decision-Making:**  Competition can sometimes incentivize unethical behavior as individuals prioritize personal gain above all else. Emphasizing cooperation cultivates a sense of ethical responsibility towards others and encourages leaders who make decisions with the common good in mind.

**Circumstances where Competition Can Be Beneficial:**

There are certainly situations where competition can be a driving force. 

* **Individual Innovation:**  In fields like research and development, healthy competition can push individuals to innovate and strive for groundbreaking solutions. 
* **Raising Standards:**  In some industries, competition can drive up quality and efficiency as companies strive to outperform their rivals.

**However, these benefits can be achieved without neglecting cooperation:**

* **Healthy Competition:**  Encouraging a culture of healthy competition focused on continuous improvement rather than solely on winning can lead to positive outcomes.
* **Cooperative Innovation:**  Fostering collaboration within competitive environments can lead to synergistic outcomes and accelerate progress.

**Conclusion:**

While competition has its place, I believe that instilling cooperation as the primary focus in educating young leaders is crucial.  Promoting empathy, collaboration, and ethical decision-making will ultimately lead to a more just, equitable, and sustainable society.  We need leaders who can build bridges, unite diverse perspectives, and work together to tackle the complex challenges facing our world.
