I partly agree with the statement that video cameras have become an essential form of contemporary documentation, offering a unique perspective that written records cannot match. However, I strongly maintain that both video cameras and written records remain indispensable, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and neither can replace the other.

Advocates of video cameras argue that they capture visual, auditory, and motion elements, effectively rendering immersive and detailed representations of real-life events. They are evident in various contexts, such as police body cameras, social media platforms, and even in everyday life such as security cameras. These visual records offer invaluable insights into non-verbal communication and situations where written description may fall short.

For instance, watching a video of a political rally can show the energy and engagement of the crowd, the reactions of participants, and the overall atmosphere compared to merely reading a written account. These nuances might be missed in written reports and, as such, videos can play an essential role in our understanding of contemporary life.

However, video recordings also have limitations. They require technical competence, such as proper framing, editing, and sound, to effectively convey information. Furthermore, they can be easily manipulated, leading to questions about their credibility. For example, deepfake videos can distort people's statements and appearances, raising concerns about the integrity of video content as historical records.

On the other hand, written records have their own advantages. They are succinct, easily searchable, and can convey complex ideas more clearly. Written records like speeches, articles, and books offer a permanent record of thoughts, ideas, and information without the risk of manipulation or technical limitations. Written records also require minimal resources to access and consult, making them more universally available. For instance, a written transcript of a historical event can be easily translated, made accessible, and archived for future generations to study and learn from.

To conclude, while video cameras offer an invaluable contribution to contemporary documentation, I believe that written records remain essential. Both forms should complement each other, compensating for each other's weaknesses and reinforcing their strengths. In a balanced fashion, video cameras and written records can work together to offer the most comprehensive and accurate documentation of contemporary life. Their unique strengths make it clear that neither form can replace the other, and the continued existence of both forms is a testament to the need for a diversified approach to documentation.
