I disagree with the statement to a certain extent. While it is true that political leaders may sometimes need to withhold information for security or strategic reasons, I believe that transparency and accountability are essential for a healthy democracy. In today's complex and interconnected world, the public has a right to access information that affects their lives and well-being.

There are several reasons why transparency is important in politics. Firstly, it promotes trust and accountability. When leaders are transparent in their decision-making processes, the public can see how and why decisions are made, which helps to build confidence in the government. Secondly, it allows for effective oversight and checks and balances. Transparency makes it easier for lawmakers, media, and civil society organizations to monitor the government's actions and ensure that they are acting in the best interests of the people.

However, there may be circumstances in which leaders may need to withhold information for security or strategic reasons. For example, during times of war or crisis, the government may need to protect sensitive information to prevent the enemy from gaining an advantage. In such cases, it is important to strike a balance between the need for transparency and the need for national security.

In conclusion, while I agree that there may be some situations in which transparency is not desirable, I believe that the benefits of transparency far outweigh the potential drawbacks. In today's world, where information is more accessible than ever before, the public has a right to know what their leaders are doing and why. By promoting transparency and accountability, we can build a more trustworthy and effective government that serves the needs of the people.

Examples that shape my position:

1. The COVID-19 pandemic: During the pandemic, many governments around the world faced criticism for moving too slowly to release information about the virus and its spread. In retrospect, it became clear that transparency was essential in building public trust and coordinating a response to the crisis.
2. The Edward Snowden revelations: In 2013, whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the US National Security Agency (NSA) was collecting massive amounts of data on American citizens. The disclosure led to a national debate about the balance between national security and privacy, highlighting the importance of transparency in government surveillance programs.
3. The Watergate scandal: In the 1970s, a series of investigative reports revealed that President Richard Nixon and his administration had illegaly covered up a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters. The scandal led to Nixon's resignation and reinforced the importance of transparency in government accountability.
