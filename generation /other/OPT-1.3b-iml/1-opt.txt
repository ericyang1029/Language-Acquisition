 for a society to prepare its young people for leadership in government, industry, or other fields is by instilling in them a sense of cooperation, not competition.

 I do agree with this statement because it is true that the youth of today are more likely to lead in the future than they were during the last few decades. However, competition is a necessary part of our system of government, and in order to improve the quality of our education system, we need to ensure that the best and brightest students get the most opportunities to learn. This is why I am opposed to a policy that would promote a policy of competitive competition at the expense of cooperative cooperation.
If the goal is to prepare the youth to lead in the future, then encouraging competition should not be used as the only way. On the contrary, the best way to prepare young people is to ensure that they have an adequate education system, both through public and private systems, that has a high emphasis on cooperative learning. If we want young people to compete in the future, then we must improve the quality of education systems by expanding their capacity for cooperative learning. We cannot allow the best and brightest to be trapped in a system that emphasizes competitive competition to the detriment of cooperative learning. The best way to help young people to compete in the future is by encouraging a policy that would allow the government to invest in cooperative learning. Competition and cooperation are both needed in order to keep our society moving forward. This means that the government should provide resources that allow more of the population to have access to better education, in order to encourage cooperation.

I believe that competitive competition should not be used as the only way to teach or engage in cooperative learning. There are many other ways that the government can encourage cooperative learning in the education system.

The government should give students more choice about the course they want to take, so that their learning can continue without being limited by the course that was selected in the
