I strongly disagree with the statement that the best way to teach is to praise positive actions and ignore negative ones. While positive reinforcement can be a valuable tool in any teaching context, relying solely on praise while ignoring mistakes undermines  students' understanding, discourages critical thinking, and overall limits their learning potential. 

Here's why: 

* **Ignoring negative feedback inhibits learning:** For students to learn effectively, they need to understand where they're going wrong, and how their work can be improved.  Ignoring mistakes creates a sense of false invincibility and prevents students from developing the necessary skills to navigate difficulties and seek improvement. 
* **Procrastination and passive learning:** Students may simply do the bare minimum, recognizing that negative feedback won't play a role. They might avoid taking risks, not challenge themselves, and miss opportunities for growth and real understanding.
* **Learning from mistakes is crucial:** Philosophers and researchers have long emphasized the significance of mistakes as critical learning lessons.  Acknowledging and addressing errors staff contributes to a more productive and reflective environment for learning. 
* **Developing empathy and responsibility:** Fostering a classroom culture of constructive criticism allows students to learn about different perspectives, the concepts of accountability, responsibility for their actions and choices, and develop a sense of empathy for others (especially instructors).


However, I do acknowledge the role of positive reinforcement. Adding praise for positive actions in a teaching environment encourages students to strive toward excellence and fosters a sense of participation. It enhances their perception and motivation and can set a platform for classical and operant learning. 

**Here's the nuance:**  While praise alone is not effective, it can be a powerful supplement to constructive feedback. 

**Here's how I would implement a balanced approach**:

1. **Provide specific and actionable feedback:**  Focus on what is right and how to improve, thanks to analysis and objective evidence.
2. **Avoid harsh criticism which could be demoralizing. "This piece of work needs work." is far better than "This work is awful and totally unacceptable." 
3. **Focus on the effort and progress of the student. **
4. **Use positive reinforcement in small amounts:** For example,  a simple "well done!" or "I like your effort/strategy," after a good performative act of diligence, can be a great recognition tool.  
5. **Recognize and compliment good teaching skills and behaviors:**  For mission-critical skills, like thinking critically, using research papers effectively, or embracing media critically, a grading system that seamlessly incorporates both these elements amplifies the impact of the teacher's involvement even more.  
 
Ultimately, a successful teaching methodology is a combination.  A multifaceted approach, incorporating both positive reinforcement and constructive feedback, which encourages students to express themselves, make mistakes, learn from their mistakes, grow, and achieve their best potential.
