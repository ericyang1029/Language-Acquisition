<pad>Having a global university that would teach them to solve world's problems is a good idea. It would solve global conflicts, improve the lives of people, and also create a better world. Having a university like this would be beneficial for a variety of reasons including, for example, the creation of a more efficient transportation system, and the development of a more efficient food supply chain. Ultimately, the world's problems can be solved through the study of the human side of global problems. Therefore, a global university could be a way to solve problems that are common around the world, including the common problem of hunger. For example, a global university could be a way to create more affordable food, which could help reduce world hunger, or a global university could be a way to create more affordable medicine. If a global university can do both these things then it is a win-win. If you want to solve the world's problems, you need to help solve them. By providing knowledge on global challenges, you will be able to better deal with them and build a better society in the long run. It is possible for all nations to give money to develop a global university. It is also possible for all peoples to contribute to the development of global universities. It is not only possible, but also a good idea.............................................................................................................................................................
