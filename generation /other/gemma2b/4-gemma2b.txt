I fundamentally disagree with the statement that "no field of study can advance significantly unless outsiders bring their knowledge and experience to that field of study."  While the role of outsiders in fostering innovation and cross-pollination is significant, a solely externalised approach undermines the depth of understanding and often leads to misaligned progress. Here's why:

**The Strengths of Internal Expertise:** 

* **Deep Cultivation of Disciplined Knowledge:** Fields of study are built upon a specific set of theoretical foundations, observed data, and practical methods. Without its constant and rigorous cultivation within that field's practitioners, any breakthrough would quickly evaporate. Think of surgeons, for instance. They wouldn't navigate the complexities of delicate surgical procedures without years of dedicated medical training – a knowledge base built solely by insiders.
* **In-Depth Understanding of the Field's Specific Challenges:** Outsiders may possess valuable insights that could inspire innovation within a field. However, without deep understanding of the narrow issue's nuances and a person's specific experience, this outside perspective often falls short. Imagine trying to design a bridge based solely on observation from a plane - the inherent complexities of construction and materials would require the knowledge and experience of an engineer deeply engaged with the creation process. 
* **Transforming Insight into Actionable Strategies:** Research and advancements in an individual field thrive on an internal lexicon of practical applications. Think of breakthroughs in computational linguistics – individual experts would fully acclimatize themselves and start believing in the effects of the learned theory. Just by transferring theoretical knowledge, without committing to its application within specific fields, the insight would be rendered useless.


**The Limits of External Input:**

* **"Reinvention" vs. Artistic Licence:**  While external perspectives can often spark new directions, prematurely adopting new ideas can lead to "reinvention" rather than true innovation.  The creator of a web browser; it is not the users, or outsiders, who invented the internet. Similarly, the majority of artistic achievements, especially in the realms of visual arts or music, don't start with literal "outside knowledge" but evolve due to a creative process guided by an artist's flow. 
* **Higher Friction with Internal Operational Psychology:** Complex social sciences and human behavior study, which often involve heavily robust methodologies, are only improved over time as the field's practitioners work through challenges internally. For successful design and execution, an outsider might have a wildly different approach and lead to a feeling of misunderstanding about how the existing methods were supposed to be executed in the first place.
* **Potential for Colonisation and Exploitation:** In various economically organized cultures and households, "outsiders" may be seen as coming into a domain - often, less mature, less developed, in terms of research, and less seasoned. They may not be seen as opportunities for value encounter, rather as senseless colonizers of a culture, who lack the necessary experience and understanding of the internal debate and values.
