While I understand the potential benefits of keeping certain information confidential, I generally **disagree** with the statement that withholding information from the public is often necessary or desirable for political leaders. The public's right to know, enshrined in democratic principles like transparency and freedom of information, is crucial for a robust and functioning society. 

Here's why:

**1. Erosion of Trust:** Openness fosters trust between the government and the governed. Hiding information, whether due to fear of negative public reaction or strategic interests, breeds distrust and cynicism. While disruptions occur in consolidated power across the globe, information is a tool to counter those disruptions through democratization of information. 

**2. Limited Accountability:** Political leaders, especially when in power, are accountable to the public. Keeping secrets means potentially avoiding responsibility for injustices or wrongdoings. This can lead to complacency and hinder progress in addressing pressing public concerns. Deception and lack of transparency undermines trust and hampers effective governance. A scenario leading to isolation can arise if constitutionally elected officials in power, do not publicly address matters of sovereignty and internal affairs. 

**3. Inefficiency and Costly Undermining:** Excessive secrecy can lead to a lack of oversight and an environment ripe for corruption. Citizens might lose sight of the true extent of actual problems and potential solutions needing funding, due diligence and approval. A lack of transparency can seriously undermine the credibility and effectiveness of governments in international sourcing.

**However, there are specific circumstances where withholding information might be considered justifiable. These include:**

* **Classified information about national security:** Sharing sensitive intelligence could pose serious risks to national security, especially in an age of terrorism and adversarial possibilities with overseas powers. The need to protect human lives and mitigate a large-scale catastrophe outweighs the need to disclose information. 
* **Independent legal investigations:** Protecting ongoing investigations into criminal activity or whistleblowers is often necessary.  While this information can affect public policy, we must remain vigilant to hold political leaders accountable to a population that is denied aรู้ of or importance in its decision-making process.

It is essential to keep in mind that while there may be some exceptions, relying on the justification that withholding information is increasingly necessary is dangerous and potentially oppressive to democratic governance. Frequently, the rationale of national security is historically used to limit the autonomy of the long form citizen and undermine collective identity. This can be harmful to a secular democracy open to the free exchange of ideas and knowledge.  Transparency and an informed public are not only about open budgets and tax information, but also require the ability to discuss national, political, and social issues in a free and open manner.
